# CSCE361CookBook

This cookbook was created with the Spring Framework to run on Tomcat for CSCE 361 (Software Engineering). This was a team project.

As an early foray into designing a web application with the Spring Framework from scratch while teaching others on my team about the Spring Framework, the code isn't as good as I would want.
